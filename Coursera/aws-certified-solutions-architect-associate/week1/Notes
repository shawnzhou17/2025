Security Groups vs Network ACLs:

1. Security Groups:
- Instance level firewall
- Stateful (return traffic automatically allowed)
- Can have different rules for instances in same subnet
- All inbound traffic denied by default
- All outbound traffic allowed by default

2. Network ACLs:
- Subnet level firewall
- Stateless (return traffic needs explicit allow rules)
- Applies to all instances in the subnet
- All inbound and outbound traffic denied by default

Example Use Case:
When two EC2 instances in same subnet need different traffic rules:
- Instance A: Allow HTTP (port 80)
- Instance B: Allow HTTPS (port 443)
â†’ Use Security Groups (not Network ACLs)




Question:
A solutions architect must secure the network traffic for two applications running on separate Amazon EC2 instances in the same subnet. The requirements are:
Application A: Allow inbound HTTP requests, block all other inbound traffic
Application B: Allow inbound HTTPS traffic, block all other inbound traffic (including HTTP)
Answer: B - Configure the access with security groups
Explanation:
Security groups are the correct choice because:
They act as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances
They can control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level
They allow you to specify different rules for different instances in the same subnet
You can create specific rules to:
Allow HTTP (port 80) for Application A
Allow HTTPS (port 443) for Application B
Block all other traffic by default (security groups are stateful and deny all inbound traffic by default)
Why other options are incorrect:
Network ACLs (Option A): While they can filter traffic, they operate at the subnet level and cannot distinguish between instances in the same subnet
VPC peering (Option C): This is for connecting different VPCs, not for controlling traffic within a subnet
Route tables (Option D): These control traffic between subnets/networks, not for filtering traffic to specific instances
