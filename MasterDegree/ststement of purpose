Statement of Purpose
My journey in computer science, from academic foundations to professional experience as a
software engineer, has cultivated both the technical expertise and research mindset essential for graduate
studies at the New York University . Through my professional work and mentoring experiences, I've
developed a deep interest in Distributed System and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which
aligns perfectly with New York University 's renowned research initiatives in this field.
During my undergraduate studies, I built a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals
through coursework in algorithms, data structures, and systems programming. This academic preparation
was enhanced by my professional experience as a software engineer, where I through hands-on
experience architecting and implementing large-scale software systems, I've developed a deep
understanding of distributed systems, scalable architecture, and enterprise software development that
extends well beyond theoretical knowledge . One particularly significant project involved is build an
VMS(Vendor management System) from scratch, which sparked my interest in pursuing advanced
research in this area.
As a mentor to new software engineers, I've developed skills crucial for graduate-level research
and collaboration. I've learned to break down complex technical concepts, facilitate knowledge transfer,
and foster an environment of intellectual curiosity - skills that will prove valuable in New York University 's
collaborative research environment. This experience has also reinforced my ability to manage long-term
projects and maintain focus on challenging problems, qualities essential for graduate research.
My research interests align closely with New York University 's Computer Science department's
strengths, particularly in Distributed System ,as further step while i pursue my next career goal. I'm
especially interested in working with Professor Mohammed Alam,whose research in Distributed Systems,
Cloud Computing and Machine Learning directly relates to my interest .
Beyond technical qualifications, I bring diverse perspectives from my experience that I led the
development of a mission-critical microservices architecture that handles over 1 million transactions daily..
I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to New York University 's inclusive research
community and collaborate with fellow students from varied backgrounds.
The combination of New York University 's cutting-edge research facilities, distinguished faculty,
and commitment to solving real-world problems makes it the ideal environment for my graduate studies. I
am confident that my technical background, research interests, and collaborative approach make me
well-suited for the program, and I look forward to contributing to the university's research community.
