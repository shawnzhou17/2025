# Amazon is establishing a new data center with n servers. Given two integer arrays, representing the health and size of the n servers respectively.
# Each day, only the servers with sizes within a specified range [l, r] (both inclusive) are selected for setup.
# For the next q days, you will receive a query each day. Each query provides two integers, land r, defining the inclusive size range of servers selected for setup on that day.
# For each query,find the sum of the health values of the servers within the specified size range [l, r] (both inclusive).

# Note: The health and the size of the ith (1 ≤i≤n) server are given by health[i] and size[i] respectively, assuming 1- based indexing for both the health and size arrays.

# Example
# Given, n = 5 servers, size = [4, 3, 5], health = [3, 4, 1, 2, 5], q= 1 and query = {0}.

# 1 = 1 and r = 3

# Servers with sizes 1, 2, and 3 are set up. Their health values are 3, 4, an03f-b50e-8c92be8074 @book.com
