As a seasoned software developer with experience at prominent organizations like
Maxim Healthcare Group and Dsfederal, I have built a strong foundation in full-stack
development with a focus on .NET technologies and modern web applications.
Current Role at Maxim Healthcare Group(Amergis Healthcare Staffing),At Maxim
Healthcare Group in Columbia, MD, I have been serving as a Software Developer Engineer
since March 2021. In this role, I've been instrumental in maintaining and enhancing a complex
ecosystem of over 40 projects focused on employee management and healthcare staffing
solutions. My work spans across multiple application types, including:Web applications for
timesheet management,Integration applications (Console and web services),CMS systems for
recruitment.
A significant portion of my work involves developing and maintaining RESTful APIs and
GraphQL endpoints for data exchange. I've implemented robust security measures through user
authentication and authorization systems, ensuring data protection and access control. My
technical expertise extends to working with Entity Framework Core, implementing Database
First approaches, and optimizing data operations through stored procedures and LINQ queries.
I've also contributed significantly to quality assurance and deployment automation by:Creating
NUnit test cases for functional testing,Implementing end-to-end testing using Playwright,
Managing feature flags through Unleash,Establishing and maintaining Azure pipelines for CI/CD
Prior to Maxim, I worked as a Full Stack .NET Developer at Dsfederal in Rockville, MD,
from October 2019 to October 2020. There, I was involved in the ESGR O&M Project, which
focused on supporting service members in Reserve Components. I managed three applications
and two portals built on ASP .NET Web Forms and ASP .NET Core.
At Dsfederal, I gained valuable experience in:Building responsive web interfaces using
Bootstrap,implementing Entity Framework with code-first approach,developing RESTful APIs
with comprehensive CRUD operations,working with specialized ORMs like LLBLGen Pro.
Throughout my career, I've maintained proficiency in a wide range of technologies and
tools:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, React, MUI, Bootstrap
Backend: C#, ASP .NET Core, Web API, Microservice Architecture
Database: Entity Framework Core, Dapper, SQL Server
Cloud & DevOps: Azure, Azure DevOps, AWS
T esting & Monitoring: NUnit, Playwright, Postman
Project Management: JIRA, Confluence, Agile/SCRUM methodology
In both roles, I've demonstrated strong commitment to Agile methodologies, participating
actively in daily SCRUM meetings and collaborating effectively with team members to meet
project requirements. My experience in both healthcare and government sectors has honed my
ability to work with complex systems while maintaining high standards of code quality and
security.
This diverse experience has shaped me into a well-rounded developer capable of
handling full-stack development responsibilities while adapting to  -->
